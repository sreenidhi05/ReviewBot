Display is Awesome and beautiful. Buy it without hesitating Best camera. Super display. IP 68 rating. 3 yrs Android updates. A good all rounder mobile. But missing fast charging compare with other mobiles in this price segment. Its ok for me. I personally buy this phone for camera it is good but sometimes feeling need more optimisation and battery performance also good when we get refresh rate at standard it will go for long day 120 hz can drain ur battery easily and display is also very good sound was dolby atmos was very good soo finally experiencing flagship samsung mobile haptic feedback is also nice now slowly felling love with this mobile Amazing phone , In love with its design and in hand feel Cameras are good , Amazing software experience one UI I was confused between iphone 13 and this.. but it offers telephoto lens that too with OIS and Endless customisation options in Android Battery is not that much bad ..can last a day easily Speakers are great and loud ... Surround Dolby audio .but lack bass a bit Go for it If youre getting it in under 40K Bang for buck Smooth
