The cameras are obviously better. The Dynamic Island is alright but not something I cannot live without. Face ID works smoother.\n\nI am not into games, so no comments on that. For a regular person, this phone is more than enough. And for people with other Apple devices, this is just an awesome part of the ecosystem.",
